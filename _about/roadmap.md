## Vision
Our vision is to create efficient free and open source software.

In terms of efficiency, we mean both via code efficiency (/speed) as well as memory efficiency, at least as best we can manage with a garbage collected language such as Java.

In terms of it being free and open source, we mean that anyone can do pretty much whatever they want with it (including producing proprietary software) and can make 
extensions or modifications based on their needs using the open source code.
