### Is There a Community I Can Join?
Yes! We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cWzhbU7) you're free to join to get in touch with us.

### How Can I Contribute to Tadukooverse?
Check out our [Contributing Guidelines](/community/CONTRIBUTING.html), which provide the basics along with links to more detailed guides 
as needed.

### Why Do You Use Java 14?
We're using Java 14 as part of a misunderstanding on Tadukoo's part. When he learned about the new Java release schedule, he mistook the 
long term support (LTS) release schedule of "every 3 *years*" as "every 3 *versions*". Every 3 versions would mean Java 8, 11, and 14 are 
all under LTS, but every 3 years means Java 8, 11, and 17 are the real LTS releases.

At this point, we're in deep enough into Java 14 (and quite like some of the changes), so we'll be sticking with it for now. When Java 15 and 
16 come out, we'll consider updating to those versions, and when 17 comes out, we will almost certainly update to it, since it's a proper LTS 
release.

The eventual plan will probably be to try to maintain releases for each of the active Java LTS releases to allow the most people to use 
our projects, but for now we only support Java 14.

### Why is Everything Named Tadukoo X?
Everything that's named "Tadukoo X" or "Tadukooverse X" should be seen as a working title used for convenience. Tadukoo is the screen name 
of the founder of the organization and it's easy to just name something "Tadukoo X" as a unique name for a project, rather than thinking 
up some amazing name on the spot. If you have a suggestion for a name for anything, feel free to suggest it on the appropriate repository. 

Between Tadukoo and Tadukooverse, Tadukoo is preferred since it's shorter, but a more unique name is always better than just using "Tadukoo X".

### My Question isn't Listed Here
If your question isn't listed here, you can go to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/cWzhbU7) and ask in the `#general-questions` channel, 
or another appropriate questions channel if you have a question about a specific project.
