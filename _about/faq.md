## Why Do You Use Java 14/15/16?
We were using Java 14 as part of a misunderstanding on Tadukoo's part. When he learned about the new Java release schedule, he mistook the 
long term support (LTS) release schedule of "every 3 *years*" as "every 3 *versions*". Every 3 versions would mean Java 8, 11, and 14 are 
all under LTS, but every 3 years means Java 8, 11, and 17 are the real LTS releases.

At that point, we were in deep enough into Java 14 (and quite liked some of the changes), so we stuck with it. When Java 15 and 
16 came out, we updated to those versions, and when 17 comes out, we will certainly update to it, since it's a proper LTS release.
At that point, we'll likely stick to Java 17 at least until the next LTS release. With the next LTS release, we may update to it 
outright, or we may maintain versions of our projects for both Java 17 and the new LTS release.

## Why is Everything Named Tadukoo X?
Everything that's named "Tadukoo X" or "Tadukooverse X" should be seen as a working title used for convenience. Tadukoo is the screen name 
of the founder of the organization and it's easy to just name something "Tadukoo X" as a unique name for a project, rather than thinking 
up some amazing name on the spot. If you have a suggestion for a name for anything, feel free to suggest it on the appropriate repository. 

Between Tadukoo and Tadukooverse, Tadukoo is preferred since it's shorter, but a more unique name is always better than just using "Tadukoo X".
