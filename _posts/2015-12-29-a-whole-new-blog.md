Honestly, I don't think I've ever written a blog post before. If I have, I have no idea if I wrote one on this site or not or how long ago I first created 
this blog. It was long enough that I was using my old email address and had to transfer admin status.

Anyway, I decided to start a blog now as a way to keep a journal of sorts for what I'm up to. For me, that's actually a wide variety of things. Due to that, 
I'll be using labels frequently so you can just pay attention to certain things (if you so choose). Of course I have no idea if anyone will ever read this 
anyway.

The topics I'll include will mainly be about stuff I'm programming, my ideas on philosophy and theology, and my YouTube stuff (if I don't feel like making 
a video about it). Of course other topics will probably come up, but those three are what will probably be most common. Most likely that will be the order 
for most common as well in the beginning, but they'll likely change.

Anyway, I'm planning on writing another post shortly related to something I'm programming, and my mind is focused on that right now so it'd be best to get to it.
