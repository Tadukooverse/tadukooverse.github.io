As I normally do at the new year, I try to make plans for where I'd like to get this year with stuff I'm working on. In this post, I'll be showing my plans 
for the year for programming and YouTube.

Please note that all plans may be changed throughout the year (not in this post), and this only reflects the current plan as of 1/1/16. Plans that have dates 
closer to the end of the year will probably receive the most change of all.

<center><h3>Programming</h3></center>
<center><h4>TAG</h4></center>
For TAG, I'd like to finish the API, Engine, and Game separation by the end of March. By the end of April, I want to get to v.0.0.7.0, which would put all 
the Areas from the Prologue into the game. This doesn't mean the Prologue will be complete, just that you can go to all the rooms in there (at least main 
storyline rooms).

By the end of June, I'd like to get to v.0.0.8.0, which would see a Player Select Menu when starting a new game (so you can choose other player sprites if 
available and choose Markiplier mode once again). This would also allow you to name your character (if you don't wanna be called Tadukoo).

By the end of August, I'd like to get to v.0.0.9.0, which would see more sounds put into the game (music and sound effects). These would also be the official 
sounds, not just temporary ones like currently in the game.

By the end of September, I'd like to get to v.0.0.10.0, which would see animations put in that are currently missing, like going between areas.

By the end of October, I'd like to get to v.0.0.11.0, which would add "hacking" (pressing a certain button and entering a code on objects does special stuff). 
I think eventually it will be a feature that you need in the storyline, but I'm not sure where it fits quite yet.

I'd like to make Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas updates to the game as well.

I'd like to get to v.0.0.12.0 by the end of the year, which would improve the debug system. Doing this would make it easier to test the game in the future 
and find issues.

<center><h4>Other Games</h4></center>
I'd like to make two minor games using the API and Engine that I was making with TAG. Honestly, I'd like to make STSB (Super Tadukoo Smash Bros.) once 
again, but I'm not sure that's minor enough for what I'd like to do.

<center><h4>Other</h4></center>
Every two months, I'd like to make an update to Tadukoo Bible (a Bukkit plugin I made). There are a lot of features I have planned for it, and I haven't 
really worked on it since I released v.1.0. I have v.1.1 planned, but it's a very big update and I think I could finish it if I split it into parts, 
releasing parts every two months.

I'd like to finish Tadukoo Perms, a Bukkit permissions plugin I've been working on. Finishing it would be one of the steps to help with bringing my server 
back, which I'd like to do eventually.

<center><h3>YouTube</h3></center>
<center><h4>Current Series</h4></center>
Minecraft with Tadukoo wrapped up Season 1 yesterday. For January 14th, I'd like to make a compilation video for it. I'd also like to have Season 2 this 
year consistently for every two weeks. I'm not sure if I'd like to start it on the 28th or not.

Minecraft: Order of the Stone: A Retelling of the Cave Game will continue Season 1 through January and wrap up in February (8 episodes total for the season, 
every two weeks). I'd like to start Season 2 this year, but I'm not sure when it'll start. Season 2 will be longer, with 15 episodes.

Song Time (the videos where I have a song and put pictures to it) may have new videos this year, but I'm not sure of that schedule.

The Tadukooverse Reports coming back depend on the server coming back.

<center><h4>Upcoming Series</h4></center>
Tadukoo's Tale is the only Minecraft series currently planned to be added to the channel. This would probably be closer to the end of the year, as only the 
first episode has been recorded at this point.

I'd like to get to a point where I can record TAG and upload videos about it.

I'd like to record a series of Drawn to Life.

Proving Creation is a series I'd like to start this year about proving the Bible and that God exists. It seems this series would start in the summer or later.

There are other series that I want to work on, but I don't plan on having them ready for upload this year.
