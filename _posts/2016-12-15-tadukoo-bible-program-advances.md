The Tadukoo Bible Program is a program I'm working on that will replace the Tadukoo Bible Bukkit plugin.

It took months to make the Bukkit plugin because I was hand-copying verses from biblegateway.com and then formatting them into yml format. Now with the 
program, I can download them all (and have them formatted into Properties automatically) in 17 minutes.

I also wrote a secondary plugin to take those yml files and format them into other yml files to fit into Minecraft books. Originally, it took about 2 minutes 
per chapter, meaning 39 hours of running the plugin. Now the program takes 2 minutes to do this.

The program is being designed so that it can be reused for Bukkit, Spigot, Spout, Forge, Sponge, as a stand-alone program, and much more rather than just 
Bukkit or one of the others. Currently, it only runs as a program, but I'll soon be making it work with Bukkit (and Spigot). The others will come in time, 
and hopefully I'll be able to re-use it for so much more in the future.
