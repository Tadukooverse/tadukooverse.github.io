I realized that while "Tadukoo Bible Project" does refer to an actual programming project that I've been working on, the posts I have for it are more belief-centered, so the posts will be moved to 
my personal blog over at https://tadukoo.github.io instead.

After moving those, we're done to just around 10 posts over here, which is fine since they're more oriented for this organization than the other posts are.

Tadukoo Bible Project will eventually be transferred to the Tadukooverse organization, but the belief-based posts surrounding it don't need to appear here.
