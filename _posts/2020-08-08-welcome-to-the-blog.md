Today I uploaded all of my posts from tadukoo.blogspot.com to this website. Most of them probably shouldn't have been copied over, as they don't relate to the Tadukooverse organization directly. 
So I'll be moving most of them to a new blog I'll make at https://tadukoo.github.io (I'll modify that website eventually to be more like this one in terms of style, but have it for my own personal 
stuff separate from this).

If you want a quick and dirty explanation of which pages will stay and which will go, here you go:

To stay:
- Java Look & Feel and Java Components & Layouts - they detail progress on Tadukoo Look & Feel and will include proper tutorials at some point
- Tadukoo Bible Project - eventually the Tadukoo Bible Project stuff will be transferred to Tadukooverse, so it will be relevant eventually

To Go:
- Any old blog update posts - they have no importance here
- TAG - a game I was working on that I currently have no plans to transfer to Tadukooverse (it's old and needs major changes anyway)
- The other random posts - for obvious reasons

For the record, the plan with the blog on this site is to allow any contributors to post to it with information that relates to Tadukooverse (what they're working on for it, news, guides, etc.)
