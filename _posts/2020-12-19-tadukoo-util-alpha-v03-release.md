Tadukoo Util Alpha v.0.3 was [released today](https://github.com/Tadukooverse/TadukooUtil/releases/tag/v.0.3-Alpha).

Tadukoo Util is a collection of useful utilities for any project. It's released under the MIT license so it's very free for anyone to use for their projects. For more information about 
Tadukoo Util, check out its [project page](/projects/TadukooUtil.html). For Javadocs for Tadukoo Util, visit [this page](/docs/TadukooUtil/current/index.html).

Tadukoo Util contains the following modules:
- Tadukoo Lang - provides common basic utilities such as StringUtil and Tuples
- Tadukoo Functions - provides ThrowingFunctions, ThrowingPredicates, etc. for better use than Java's non-throwing versions
