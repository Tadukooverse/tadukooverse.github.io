So I was thinking about how people use Google Translate to get weird mis-translations of things. I've done it several times before. But then I remembered that 
the thesaurus has some weird synonyms for words, so I wondered what would happen if I went there and "translated" stuff?

I took the description of this blog, "Ramblings about my programming, beliefs, videos, and more." and I got "Obiter dictums touching on my penciling in, 
postulations, telegenics, as a consequence over and above."

Essentially what you do is look at the list of synonyms and pick the silliest one. At first, I was thinking I would take that description and improve it with 
the synonyms that came up, but the temptation came to do this instead.

I think I originally used a thesaurus to get "Going-Ons of Tadukoo" as the name of the blog, but I'm not sure whether that actually happened or not.

Perhaps I could also use antonyms for more funnies in the future. I have no idea if this is something I'll continue on or not.
