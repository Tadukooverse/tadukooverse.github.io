When I first started the blog, I was doing two posts a day. I thought that I would end up doing two posts a day everyday. Unfortunately, that is not going to 
happen.

The reason I was able to do two blogs a day in the beginning was because there was a lot of information I wanted to share at that point. I should've spaced it 
out to at least one post a day, so that there wouldn't have been such a gap until now.

Anyway, I'd sort of like to make one post a day, but I know that won't happen. So right now I'd like to make one post a week at minimum, preferably two or 
three per week. We'll see what happens.
