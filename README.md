# About
## Vision
Our vision is to create efficient free and open source software.

In terms of efficiency, we mean both via code efficiency (/speed) as well as memory efficiency, at least as best we can manage with a garbage collected language such as Java.

In terms of it being free and open source, we mean that anyone can do pretty much whatever they want with it (including producing proprietary software) and can make extensions 
or modifications based on their needs using the open source code.

## Tadukoo Engine/Launcher
The [{{TadukooEngine.title}}]({{TadukooEngine.url}}) is currently the main big project Tadukooverse is working towards.

## How This Started
Back in 2019, [Tadukoo](/contributors/tadukoo.html) ended up writing more reusable code for his 1000 Blank White Cards program and it ended up splitting off into 
[Tadukoo Util](/projects/TadukooUtil.html). Then in 2020, the [{{TadukooEngine.title}}]({{TadukooEngine.url}}) split off from that, and Tadukooverse was 
born to contain the more useful projects that anyone could freely use.
