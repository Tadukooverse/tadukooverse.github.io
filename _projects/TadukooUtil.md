summary: >
  Tadukoo Util is meant as a collection of utility libraries for very common use. They can be used in conjunction with Tadukoo Engine/Launcher, or can be used separately in other programs if desired. 
  This collection is not meant as a full smorgasbord of all libraries, but is just meant to include the most common libraries to be reused in most projects 
  (e.g. common null-safe string/boolean checks, multimaps, view utilities, etc.)
