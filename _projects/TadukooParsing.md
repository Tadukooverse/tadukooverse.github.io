## Modules

### Tadukoo JSON
Tadukoo JSON is a library for parsing JSON. It uses JSONConverter to parse JSON into either a JSONClass or JSONArray. You can also use OrderedJSONClass if you care about the order of the 
keys in the object.

## Current Plans
As part of [The Tadukooverse Master Plan]({% post_url 2020-08-14-the-tadukooverse-master-plan %}), Tadukoo Parsing has 2 milestones leading up to Tadukoo Engine's release:
- Alpha v.0.1 - Complete Tadukoo JSON
- Alpha v.0.2 - Anything else needed for Tadukoo Engine's first release
