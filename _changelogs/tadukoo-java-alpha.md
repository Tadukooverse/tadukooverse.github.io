    Tadukoo Java contains the following modules:
    - Tadukoo Java - a library for parsing/generating Java code.
    
    This is the first release of Tadukoo Java. Note that it's Alpha v.0.4 because it came from Tadukoo Code Parsing, which came from Tadukoo Parsing 
    (So there's some history of it existing as earlier versions within those projects).
    Also note that this version doesn't really have parsing included, just the ability to generate Java code using the provided helper classes. 
    Future versions will include the parsing, note this is an Alpha build so not all planned features are present.
